In this example, the ElectricCar class has an additional member variable ai_algorithm which is an instance of the AIAlgorithm class. The AIAlgorithm class, in turn, has a member variable model which represents a neural network that can make predictions based on the input data.
In the accelerate method, the AI algorithm is used to determine the appropriate gear to shift to by passing the current speed, throttle position and the battery level to the determine_gear method of the AIAlgorithm class. This method returns the predicted gear which is then passed to the shift_gear method to change the gear of the car.

Keep in mind that this is a simplified example and it is not meant to be a complete implementation. Additionally, it may not have considered some important aspect of real electric car gear systems and AI algorithm, such as power consumption, energy management, torque, and the neural network architecture, weight and bias initialization, etc.
